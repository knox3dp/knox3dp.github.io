__Knox3dp__ is a local 3d printing and CAD group that started as the Knoxville CAD / Fusion 360 group in November 2015. After a brief hiatus in the Spring of 2016, the Knox3dp group has reorganized to serve interests in the Knoxville area related to 3d printing while providing a space for those who'd like to learn more about CAD.

Join us on [Meetup!](http://www.meetup.com/Knoxville-CAD-Fusion-360) and join the `#3dprinting` channel on the [KnoxDevs](http://knoxdevs.org) Slack group!
